  <!-- 
    This file has been replaced by the simplified POI system.
    The old complex definitions have been moved to POI_Content_BACKUP.xml for reference.
    
    POI content is now defined directly in POI_Defs.xml using SimplePOIDef.
    Each POI definition now contains both the spawn rules and content in one place.
